# Project-Euler-Solutions
This repository contains working code for my solutions to Project Euler problems (ProjectEuler.net)

I want to make it clear that significant time was taken to attempt every problem without peaking at 
other user's source code. In the cases where I was unable to complete an exercise on my own, I made 
sure to deeply understand outside solutions before implementing the ideas found therein. I strongly 
encourage anyone who comes across this repository to follow the same standard. Sometimes, we need help
to understand a concept. I had many graduate professors who did not understand this concept, and will 
not fall into the trap of arrogance. However, trying to figure out a thing on your own will pay dividends.

Please enjoy, and send any comments my way at wesley.neill@gmail.com
